## OpenSwells;

### Overview

**[OpenSwells](https://go-surf-app-438594f906bc.herokuapp.com/)** is a free, open-source **surf report** and **16 day swell forecast from 170+ locations**. Reports and forecasts are from the [The Environmental Modeling Center Operational Wave Models](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/index.php).
New forecasts are received every 6 hours. 

### Previously

This project was previously a 3 day forecast for my local beach using an LSTM network, and later graph neural networks ([site](https://go-ml-surf-forecast.onrender.com/), [github](https://github.com/evancoons22/nbdc-buoy-data)). I have since expanded it to include a 16 days forecast for 170+ locations thanks to Environmental Modeling Center and NOAA.
